## MONOS APPLICATION
## Installation
Clone the git repository from the developer's GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/munyua-arch/Monos-Application
Setup
Install Composer (PHP Package Manager):

Download Composer from https://getcomposer.org/download/.
Run the following command in your terminal using Composer:

bash
Copy code
composer install
This command will install the necessary dependencies, including the CodeIgniter4 framework, which is located in the vendor folder.

Update CodeIgniter4 Version:

If the composer.json file does not specify the current version of CI4, update the version as follows:

Copy code
"require": {
    "php": "^8.1",
    "codeigniter4/framework": "^4.5.0"
}
This ensures youâ€™re using the version of CodeIgniter4 that was committed to GitHub.

php
